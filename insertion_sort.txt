[Array index starting from 1]
1. Accept elements of array arr
2. FOR i = 1 to n
	2.1. pos = i
	2.2. WHILE pos>=1 and arr[pos]>=arr[i]
		2.2.1. pos = pos - 1;
	2.3. pos = pos + 1; // 'pos' is the indice where 'i' should be inserted
	2.4. e = arr[i] //save the 'i'th element in a variable, as we are going to overwrite it
	2.5. FOR j = i to pos+1 (decreasing loop)
		2.5.1. arr[j] = arr[j-1]
	2.6. arr[pos] = e
3. Display array
